    //////////////////////////////////AREA DESCRIPTIONS
    <string name="things_betwixt_des">
        Things Betwixt is a Location in Dark Souls 2. It is a cold, dark cave where players begin their journey.
        Be careful of the ledges and Ogres in the area that may lead to an instant death; leave the ogres for now, as you can come back for them later.
        In this area, there is also a Coffin behind a pair of Ogres which has the ability to change the player\'s gender if they were to enter it. Changing the player\'s gender is purely cosmetic, and can be reversed if the Coffin is entered once more. Dyna and Tillo can be found on a ledge, requesting Smooth and Silky Stones for rewards; leave this too, as again, you can come back for them later.

    <string name="transgressors_staff_des">A staff enwreathed in a matte blackness. Found in the heart of the Dark Chasm. A catalyst for sorceries and hexes.  No one knows what lies beyond the dark passages found across Drangleic, but perhaps they are better left undisturbed.</string>

It gained knowledge, and learned to lure humans into its lair using song.</string>
    <string name="archdrake_staff_des">Staff of members of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. A catalyst for sorceries and hexes.  In Lindelt, known for its clerics and their miracles, sorcery is believed to be a profane practice.

    <string name="bat_staff_des">Staff used by hollowed Drangleic sorcerers. A catalyst for sorceries and hexes.  The bat affixed to its tip is a simple charm. It has no bearing on the staffs powers, but the germs on the cadaver poison foes upon contact in strike attacks.</string>

    <string name="spotted_whip_des">A whip born from the soul of the Demon of Song. Covered with strange spots that betray its poisonous effects.  The Demon\'s sonorous voice, in stark contrast to its hideous form, is surely intended to lure people close so that it may devour them.</string>
    <string name="old_whip_des">"A leather whip that has seen plenty of use. It appears no different than an ordinary whip, but is charmed by an ancient blessing that boosts damage inflicted on Hollows.  The blessing is likely the work of a cleric, but whether the spell is good or evil is unclear. "</string>
    <string name="long_bow_des">A standard bow used by hunters. Equip arrows to use.  Equip up to two types of arrows to give yourself immediate options in battle. Use arrows to hit enemies from afar to gain the upper hand by drawing blood first.</string>

Although not a proper catalyst, the bellvine is quite powerful.</string>
    <string name="priests_chime_des">Sacred chime granted to high-ranking clerics. A catalyst for miracles and hexes.
